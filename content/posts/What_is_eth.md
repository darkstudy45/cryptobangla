# Understanding Ethereum: The Basics

Ethereum is a decentralized, open-source blockchain platform that enables the creation of smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). It was first proposed in 2013 by Vitalik Buterin, a Canadian programmer and cryptocurrency researcher.

Unlike Bitcoin, which is primarily used as a digital currency, Ethereum is a platform that allows developers to create and deploy their own decentralized applications. These applications are powered by smart contracts, which are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement written directly into code.

## How Ethereum Works

Ethereum operates on a blockchain, which is a decentralized, digital ledger that records transactions across a network of computers. This network is maintained by a network of nodes, which are computers that run the Ethereum software.

When a user wants to execute a smart contract or interact with a dApp on the Ethereum network, they must pay a small fee in the form of Ether (ETH), the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum network. These fees are used to compensate the nodes for the computing power and resources they use to process and validate transactions.

## Smart Contracts and dApps

The key innovation that sets Ethereum apart from other blockchain platforms is its support for smart contracts. These are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement written directly into code. This allows for the automation of complex processes and eliminates the need for intermediaries, such as lawyers or banks.

dApps are decentralized applications that run on the Ethereum network and are powered by smart contracts. These applications are open-source, meaning that anyone can access and review the code. This transparency helps to ensure the security and integrity of the dApps.

Some examples of dApps built on Ethereum include:

- Cryptocurrency wallets
- Decentralized exchanges
- Online marketplaces
- Gaming platforms

## Conclusion

Ethereum is a powerful blockchain platform that enables the creation of smart contracts and decentralized applications. Its decentralized nature, combined with its support for smart contracts, makes it an attractive option for developers and businesses looking to build decentralized solutions. However, it is important to note that the Ethereum network is still in its early stages and may have scalability issues as it continues to grow.
